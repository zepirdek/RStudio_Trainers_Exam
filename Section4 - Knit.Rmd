### KNIT R Markdown


We have writen some text and codes to be converted them as a html report. It is time to print it out with **knit** operation.  


```{r}

a = 10
b = 20
c = 2 

z = a * b / c 

print(z)
print(paste("How many times have you tried to run  this code?", z, " times?"))
  

```
